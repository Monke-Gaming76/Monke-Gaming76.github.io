        <h1>ESSAY???</h1>
        <div class="container">
        <p>New York is a big city; there’s a lot of people.  Not much I can change about it.  Sometimes, it can be hard for me to find something to do, with all of the places I can go and see.  Go to a museum, go to the East River, ride the subway, there’s a lot to do in NYC.  I happen to really enjoy fencing, not for the cool costumes or the blades, but for the elegance. Obviously, most NYC homes don't have the enough room to practice an active sport like fencing, so places like Fencers Club exist.  Right next to the Empire State Building, Fencers Club has produced some of the best fencers in the US, with a few Olympic competitors. Fencers Club is like NYC: loud, bright, full of all sorts of people, where I have to be constantly improving myself to keep up.</p>
        <p>I find it hard to talk to new people.  Especially in a sports setting.  What if they say a term or a word or have some lingo that I don't know?  What if they don't talk to me?  What if they don't want to fence?  I was pretty scared because I would just be inserting myself into this group of people.  So after my mom forced me to go one day, I met another fencing senior from NEST, and it was nice to see a familiar face.  We fenced a few times, and while we were resting, he invited me to fence with his friends. So I met a few people, and turns out, they were really nice.  After the first few times, I was still a bit nervous, but I decided to just ask people to fence.  As my friend said, “They’re not gonna say they don't want to fence you.”  Whenever I saw someone free (who was not 2 feet taller than me), I asked them to fence.  Quickly, I learned a new lesson. </p>
        <p>Apparently, the people at Fencers Club are REALLY good.  At first, every time I would fence someone, they would absolutely dominate me. They’d get 15-2 touches, (points) and honestly, it was really discouraging.  I would get back home, hot and sweaty, and just kinda feel bad.  It always sucks to lose.  So I reflected on myself.  What I was doing wrong, any mistakes I made.  I tried to notice if certain people had some preference for a parry or were using a “creative” strategy.  So I learned.  I didn’t become the best, but I started learning about different processes, different situations in fencing.  For example, there was this guy called Allan who was ambidextrous, and he would change hands depending if his opponent was left-handed or right-handed.  And he was really smart for doing this, since people are generally used to fencing right-handed people, creating habits and “creative” strategies.  So by mirroring an opponents’ dominant side, Allan would throw off an opponent’s habits and muscle memory.  These kinds of observations helped me make small improvements.  With this, every time I fenced him, I started trying to have a more positive outlook on the game, not caring if I lost or won (still I was really happy when I won), but trying to learn something from the experience.  It's like being in New York. Being able to adapt to any situation, make the best out of challenges, the classic New Yorker spirit.  </p>
        <p>All of the people at Fencers Club are really competitive.  Some people yell really loud when they score a point, and others are very serious when they play. This one time, a super competitive fencer challenged me. To my surprise, I noticed that he was holding back.  Like a cat batting a mouse, playing with its food.  When I scored a point against him, he said “oooh that was a good one.”  And I respected him a lot for that.  That was a great experience for me, showing me that a really good competitive spirit is very important in fencing, and any other sport.  But the difference between having an overly competitive toxic attitude and a good healthy competition is just simple sportsmanship.  I like to build my skills off of this competitive spirit, trying to learn from my mistakes.  Similarly, NYC is full of competition.  So many people living in one consolidated area, how could there not be?  Using this mindset, any obstacle that NYC throws at me is an opportunity to learn something new.</p>
        <p>New York is a big city; there’s a lot of people.  It's hard to find places that truly exemplify the NYC spirit, like Fencers Club does.  Full of all sorts of people who challenge me to grow and improve on our individual paths to greatness.  To me, Fencers Club will be an epic memory of NYC.</p>
